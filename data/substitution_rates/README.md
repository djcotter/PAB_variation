### Substitution rates

The substitution rates calculated here are provided for convenience. They are calculated using the Galaxy Project tool `Estimate Substitution Rates` after applying our callable sites and regions filters. They correspond to the different filters that are listed in the `config.yml` file.

The file `divergence_ratios_JC69-corrected_filter1-5.txt` is created by running the rule `divergence_JukesCantor69_correction` on the X chromosome regions files and the chr8 wholeChr files for filters 1 through 5 and then using the resulting JC69 corrected rates to create the entries in this table. The ratios are the result of dividing each of the X chromosome regions by the chr8 autosome value.
